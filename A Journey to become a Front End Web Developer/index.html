          <p class="text-justify padding-t-b-8 mdc-typography--body1">I’m an aspiring front-end web developer with an interest in building things that make life easier and bring happiness.
            Also, I have been acquiring skills in UI & UX design. Previously, I was a classical pianist which I studied in
            Venezuela, Russia, and Spain. I have lived and worked in Europe for several years. My background allows me to aid companies looking to enter the international market. I speak Spanish, Italian, English, and Russian.
 
          <p class="text-justify padding-t-b-8 mdc-typography--body1">I am an adventurous, determined and art-loving person, who likes to explore the beauty of life in its different
            facets. In my free time, I play piano, hike, and ski. I also love to explore new cultures, and it has led me to
            live in: London, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Breckenridge, Padua, Boulder and now Denver.</p>

                  <p class="mdc-typography--body2">I am learning how to use the terminal on my computer because it is a tool that is going to help me to
                    work with my files in a faster and better way than a graphical interface. And as a future web developer,
                    I really want to take advantage of these kinds of tools that are going to do my work routine better.</p>

              <p class="padding-t-b-8">Learning the commands to use the terminal on the computer, in general, was not difficult, it was like a game.
                The part where I struggle a little more was when I needed to move files that were inside others files to a specific location inside others files. But after playing a little around I almost got it right 80% of the times. I already feel the benefits of using the command line, it is faster and easier to look around (files, documents),
                copy, editing, etc., and there are a lot of things that you can do in one step in comparison with the graphical
                interface.
              </p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">When I started to learn the command line I didn’t do a bad job in set my stage for study, but I was in a table next to other classmates and I couldn’t focus in the beginning. That made me ask for help when I really did not need. After a break a changed my location for a place where I was a long and it was quiet. There I focus really well. And it allowed me to play with the command, I repeat them until I could use them in a more “automatic way”.</p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">Now that I figured out what is the best way for me to learn the commands to use the terminal and what is the
                logic in it, I am looking forward to learning a couple of commands every day.</p>

              </p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">I am learning "Git" because it allows me to keep track of the changes I do in my files or folders. And I learning
                "Github" because this service online lets me have a remote copy of my projects. "Github" also allows me to
                have a track of the changes I make in my files and folders, it allows me to share them and to collaborate
                with other projects. </p>

              <p class="padding-t-b-8">AIn the beginning, it was a little complicated to understand exactly how it works. You need to follow more than
                one step to save, update and send the changes that you do in a specific file, folder and repository in
                your computer and in Github.</p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">I read and read again the material support, I draw down the process. I got inside the command line and "Github"
                website and I practiced the process of saving the files and folders multiple times or a lot of times! Now I
                got it. These are very important because you need to be sure that you save your projects in the right way.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="width-col text-justify mdc-typography--body1">

              <p>Apart from closing the windows that I don’t need on my computer and turning off my phone, I also need to be
                in a quiet place and alone for a certain type of learning. For example, if I am going to learn new concepts or write reflections of my work. If I do not have the full set up of my stage, I am going to perform this kind of task in a longer period of time it won't have a very high quality.</p>
              <p>Now that I know the basic of git and Github, I hope I can use it to do more than save my projects. I would
                like to begin soon to share my projects and to be available to collaborate with the projects of other people.
                These are the next step I would like to follow with this. I know that on the way I am going to discover other
                things that I can do with git and Github.</p>

              <h6 class=" padding-t-b-16 font-bold mdc-typography--headline6">Set the Stage</h6>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">CSS Flexible Box Layout Module also know as Flexbox.</p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">I am learning Flexbox as one of the many topics that I need to know in order to define the visual style of
                a web page. It is a way to distribute content in a flexible way on a website and this is a very important
                aspect in the design of the user interface.</p>
                <h6 class=" padding-t-b-16 font-bold mdc-typography--headline6">Play</h6>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">After you understand how to think when using flexbox, that is, how the items move according to the axis that
                affects them, everything becomes quite easy and you feel the benefits of being able to control properties such as the size or alignment of one or a group of items at a time. It is quite a handful to use, and it gives
                you the possibility to do very nice things in the user interface.</p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">(see more in the video)</p>
            </section>
            <section class="width-col text-justify mdc-typography--body1">
              <h6 class=" padding-t-b-16 font-bold mdc-typography--headline6">Reflection</h6>
              <p>Organizing the stage to study this topic and any other is totally necessary because you need to be very concentrated
                to absorb new concepts or skills in the right way.</p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">In this particular subject you have to understand the flow of the elements in their axes, and then understand
                all the properties with their respective values which you can apply in the organization of an item or a group
                of items in space. If when you are in the process of understanding it, you get distracted, the more likely
                it is that you have to start over, because it is very easy to lose the thread at the beginning when you do
                not have domain yet of which property affects which element according to which axis and all of it starts
                to move, extend, shrink ,etc. in the opposite direction to your desires.</p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">With the knowledge of flexbox I am going to be able to lay out items by controlling their dimensions and the
                spacing between them in a very skill way that allow me to have a more creative and a faster form of doing
                a user interface. Now that I understand the basics of the CSS Flexible Box Layout, I can first, go deeper
                in the use of their properties to expand my possibilities of creating websites and second, I can compare
                It with CSS Grid Layout and find out the difference between them, their benefits and when is better to use
                each one or both.</p>

              <li class="padding-t-b-8">Build multi-page websites drills
                <span class="font-bold">a</span> went well because I divided this big goal into a smaller goals. It was specific goal because I only
                focused in two objective: 1)HTML for the page. 2)CSS - only the distribution of the elements in the page.
                It was achievable because with my skill level I could finished this two objectives and for that reason it
                was also a relistic goal. It was timely because I organized myself in the way that I had enough time to achieve
                the goal.</li>
              <li class="padding-t-b-8">Learn-to-learn techniques were a specific goal because I only focused on reading the support material, I did not
                set out to study or read the material and do the exercises about it as well. It was an achievable goal because
                I already knew the amount of material I had to read and analyze. I began a &quot;bullet notebook&quot;, which allowed me to see the time I had available on the day to complete this goal, that's why it was timely, and realistic because the goal fulfilled all the above-mentioned characteristics.</li>
              <li class="padding-t-b-8">Review 3 Units from &quot;Essential Grammar in Use&quot; was a specific goal because I limited the number of
                units to three. Measurable goal because it was a review of something I already knew for that I could calculated how much time I needed to reinforce those units. And timely because I schedule for the right moment in my day on my &quot;bullet notebook&quot;. In summary, it was also a realistic goal because I reached to complete
                this task.</li>
              <li class="padding-t-b-8">The piano goal in the way I wrote down it was very ambiguous. Because I knew what I am going to do when I play
                piano on the day. But if I count the right way to write a goal it was specific neither measurable. It was
                realistic because I played piano that day, and It was achievable because I did what I was thinking to do.
                Also, It was timely because I played piano at the moment I could take better advantage of the goal I wanted
                to achieve with it, which was to disconnect and relax.

              <p class=" padding-t-b-16 font-bold mdc-typography--subtitle2">What I Learned</p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">From Liz MacDonald, I learned about the process she is living in her job because T mobile bought the star up
                where she was working, now she works for T Mobile. Also at the meetup, she was helping her team working us
                a recruiter, for that, when I talked to her I told her that I was a web developer student and I asked her
                what was the web developer skill with more demand in the industry now and she told me that the industry (or
                T Mobile) needs a more front-end web developer.</P>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">From Brent Marques I got the name of a bunch of web developers meetups in Loveland, Fort Collins, and Lafayette. Also
                we were talking about how you can feel overwhelming for all the web development information out there and how difficult is to filter this information when you are self-taught trying to learn to code. After that
                we were discussing the importance to have a good community to do it.</p>
              <p class="padding-t-b-8">And From Patrick Mclaughlin I learned I little about his school and also the process of being looking for a
                job when you finish your studies at the meetup. The make me a little scared. I am not afraid of the interviews,
                I am afraid to do not find a job or a good job (I think everyone feels the same of course)</p>

                <li class="padding-t-b-8">How to introduce myself to the recruiter or to the companies who are looking for a web developer in a professional
                  but at the same time friendly way? (One of the reasons that I always think about that is because I don't want they to see in me only that I am a part of a minority group in the industry (woman and latina) and for that, they should hire me. I would like when I introduce myself, to show them that I have or I will
                  have a high-level skill and for that, they should hire me)
